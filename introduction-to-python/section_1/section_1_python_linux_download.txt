Check your Python installation for Linux1. Start up a Terminal. You can find the Terminal application at Applications/Accessories/Terminal, or it may already be on your menu bar.This Terminal is another way of navigating your computer and running programs -- just textually instead of graphically. We are going to be running Python and Python scripts from this Terminal.2. Test your Python installation at the Terminal prompt by typingpython and pressing Enter. You should see something likePython 3.4.1 (v3.4.1:d047928ae3f6, May 13 2013, 12:45:22)  [GCC 4.3.2] on linux2 Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>>  You just started Python! The >>> indicates that you are at a new type of prompt -- a Python prompt. The Terminal prompt lets you navigate your computer and run programs, and the Python prompt lets you write and run Python code interactively.3. Exit the Python prompt by typingexit() and pressing Enter. This will take you back to the Linux Terminal prompt.If your Python version started with a 3, you are done with this section.If your Python version started with a 2, you may have a version of Python 3 installed, just not as the default Python. Typepython3 at a Terminal prompt.If this starts Python, you have a version of Python 3 installed, just not as the default Python. Please use the command python3 instead of python to start Python for the rest of this course.If you have no version of Python 3 installed, we'll need to install it. Please continue to the instructions in the next section.Install PythonPlease install Python 3.4 using your package manager, or from source using the source release here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/. Please use the command python3 instead of python to start Python for the rest of this course.Success!You have tested your Python installation.
